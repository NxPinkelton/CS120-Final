# CS120-Final

My goal for this project was to make a fighting game. You choose your character's class, which would assign it certain stats, and then your character would fight enemies on the screen.

The instructions are simple: Move your character around the screen to chase your enemy down. Run into your enemy to fight it. Once you or your enemy is down for the count, the game will end.

I used Thonny for this project (which uses Python). I also used pygame and simpleGE (which was given by our teacher, Andrew Harris).

All of my resources came from https://opengameart.org . The images and the music.

I learned quite a bit from this process. I learned how to implement graphics, how to make sprites and move them around on a scene. How to make multiLabels and Buttons. This whole process has also helped me understand how to use classes a bit better, and how main can be used to tie everything together. 
I got stuck on how to make certain attributes communicate their information to each other, as well as to other classes/functions.

I would like to improve my planning abilities and understanding of classes and functions. I have begun grasping at how to effectively plan while using them, but I could be much better. I would also like to better my understanding on the components that make up classes and game engines.

Next time, I would like to have more time to do all the things that I wanted to with this program. I didn't have as much time to work on it because of personal reasons, but if I were to do things again, I would try and implement all the details that I had to skip. This includes an intro scene that gives you character classes to choose from, as well as multiple enemies that can be fought. I would also have liked to figure out how to make the enemy stats pop up when collisions happened, and then disappear when they were defeated.

I strayed quite far from the game design document. There was only one enemy (and the enemy moves, instead of being stationary), no intro screen or character classes to choose from, my algorithm in the document wasn't fully fleshed out, and even if it was it wouldn't be the most practical to follow.

I stayed on track with the general idea of the game, I had the collisions working (somewhat), and I was able to get some cool sounds in the game. I was also able to make an end screen after the enemy or character was defeated.
